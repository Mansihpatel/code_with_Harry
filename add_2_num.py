# write a program to add two numbers
# a = 2
# b = 4
# print(a+b)

# Write a program to find remainder when number is devided by z 

# a=9
# b=3

# print("reminder of a to b is",a%b)

#3. check the type of the variable assigned using input() function 
# a = input("Enter a number")
# print(type(a))

#4. use comparision operator to find out weather a given variable is greater than 'b' or not a = 34, b = 80
a = 34
b = 80
a>b

#5. find a average of two numbers 

num1 = int(input("enter a number"))
num2 = int(input('enter 2nd number'))
print("average is ",(num1+num2)/2)

#6. write a python program to calculate square of a number entered by the user 
num = int(input("enter a number"))
squr = num * num 
print(squr)
